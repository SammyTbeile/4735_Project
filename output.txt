nar: as he was usually called. He was lust a kid himself, but he was much bigger and stronger than most of the others.  He was a real bully if you ever saw one. In fact, he was the world’s ﬁrst big bully!  His name was Tyrone — or Tyrone the Horrible,‘     s'i—tiv r

nar: Tyrone especially liked to pick on Boland. He punched and teased him and always stole his snack or sandwich.
Page  7
nar: Boland tried to stay out of Tyrone‘s way, but it seemed that no matter where he went, Tyrone was waiting for him.
Page  8
nar: Night after night. Boland had a hard time getting to sleep. He kept thinking of ways to avoid Tyrone. It seemed hopeless.

nar: Boland’s playmates tried to help.  
one: You have to get Tyrone to be your friend,
nar:  Terry said to Boland one day.  
two: That's easier said than done,
nar:  said Boland.  
two: How do you make friends with someone who has been hurting and teasing you all your life?
nar:   
one: You have to give him a present and show him you care.
nar:  Terry said.  Boland thought for a while. What kind of present could he give Tyrone? Then he remembered how Tyrone was always taking his snacks and sandwiches.  
two: A present for Tyrone?
nar:  he said. 
two: Well, at least it’s worth a try.

nar: That afternoon, Boland went looking for Tyrone. .‘ ‘1‘ 
nar:  he said in his friendliest voice. 
three: It's such a hot day, ‘ 7' I thought you might like a nice ice-cream cone.
nar:   Tyrone looked at Boland for a moment. Then  he smiled a nasty smile. 
three: Ice cream for me? How sweet!

Page  12
nar: Tyrone grabbed the cone. Then he turned it upside down and squashed it on Boland‘s head.  
Page  13
nar: The next day, Boland told his friend Stella what had happened.  
four: You are taking this too seriously,
nar:  Stella said. 
four: Don’t pay any attention to that big bully when he tries to tease you. Just stay cool. That’s the only thing he’ll understand.
nar:   
two: Staying cool when you are scared is not easy,
nar:  Boland said. 
two: But I will try.

nar: And so the next time Boland met Tyrone, he ¢ stayed cool.  
three: Hi, Lizardhead!
nar:  roared Tyrone as Boland walked by.

nar: When Boland‘s friends found out what Tyrone had done, they were furious.  
five: It’s time to ﬁght back!
nar:  Stego said. 
two: Tyrone has given you enough trouble. You must stand up to him and show him you are a dinosaur, too. You can win any ﬁght against him. Tyrone just has a big mouth, that’s all.
nar:   Boland was angry, too. 
five: You’re right!
nar:  he said. 
five: Maybe I should ﬁght him and stop this nonsense once and for all.
nar:   
five: Well,
nar:  Stego said, 
Page  18
nar: Boland stood up and faced Tyrone the Horrible. 
nar:  he said. 
three: I have had enough of your bullying. Come on and ﬁght!
nar:   Tyrone took one look at Boland, then grinned and said, 
three: Okay. if that's what you want.

nar: It was a very short ﬁght. Little Boland had no chance against his big enemy. 
five: I'm sorry.
nar:  Stego said. 
five: That was not a very good idea. You‘d better give up. Some bullies you iust can‘t beat. You have to learn to live with them.  whether you like. it or not.
Page  21
nar: But Boland did not like it. 
nar:   he thought. He was still thinking as the moon came out  and the stars ﬁlled the sky. Suddenly he smiled a big smile.  
Page  22
Page  23
nar: The next morning Boland took his sandwich and went off into the swamp forest as usual. It wasn‘t  long before he ran into Tyrone. 
three: Another snack for me?
nar:  roared Tyrone. 
Page  24
three: AAaaaaaarghhhhhh!
nar:  It was Tyrone. Huge ﬂames were coming out of his mouth. 
three: HELP, I’m burning,
nar:  he cried. 
Page  25
two: Nonsense!
nar:  Boland said with a laugh. 
Page  26
nar: From then on, Tyrone stayed as far away from Boland as he could. Boland played happily with his friends in the  swamp forest all day, and he never had trouble falling asleep at night.

nar: When much, much later some scientists found Tyrone the Horrible, he looked a little different — but he still had that nasty smile on his face.
